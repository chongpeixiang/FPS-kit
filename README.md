# FPS-kit

This is a demonstration fps using the Panda 3D game engine. The ultimate goal is to create a FPS kit - a framework for people intending to make fps-s (Or other genres - the system is very flexible.).

In its current state a playable environment exists, with all the key components of a fps, except for enemies. (You can still shoot cans of spam however!) Key things it demonstrates are how to handle levels in a game, use of a plugin architecture and a few examples of fx. Polish is lacking however, and most of the artwork is of the programmer variety.

This is fork of "Naith" project. See old_licence.
